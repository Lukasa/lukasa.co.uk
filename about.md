## Hi. I'm Cory.

I'm a software engineer, a physics graduate, and an Australian/British dual
citizen. Want to find out more? Pick a topic below and let's get started.

Alternatively, if you just want to chat or see my work, you can find me on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Lukasa), or on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Lukasaoz).

If you're concerned about data privacy when contacting me, here's some useful
information. I live and work in **London**, in the **United Kingdom**. My
personal email accounts are currently managed by **Google**. My work email is
managed by my employer, **Hewlett Packard Enterprise**. My websites are hosted
by **GitHub**.

### Me

I was born in Sydney, Australia, but I moved to Melbourne when I was very
young. I grew up in Melbourne, and spent my teenage years in Oxford, England. I
went to university in St Andrews, Scotland. Now, as an adult, I'm a software
engineer living in London.

Software engineering is my dream job and what I love to do. I work at an
[Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/uk/en/home.html) building
open source HTTP software for the Python community. It's a fantastic job, and
you'll find me doing it more often than is strictly healthy.

In addition to programming, I love reading, watching films and television, and
sports. I'm a huge fan of a number of sports teams, including (for my sins) the
Melbourne Demons.

If you feel like chatting (and I always do), you can find me on a number of
social networks, and on IRC, where I'm `lukasa`.

### Employment / Open Source

I'm an active member of the Python open-source community, both in my spare time
and in my day job. At my day job, I work for
[Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/uk/en/home.html), building
open source Python HTTP software, which is my long-time passion.

I'm a member of the [Python Requests](http://python-requests.org/) core
development team, working with [Kenneth Reitz](http://kennethreitz.org/) and
[Ian Cordasco](http://www.coglib.com/~icordasc/index.html#resume). In addition,
I manage several of the associated libraries, including the OAuth extension for
Requests. I also develop my own extensions for Requests, as well as being a
core contributor to [urllib3](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3).

Away from Requests, I develop several of my own open-source projects, as well
as contributing to the open-source projects of others. Amongst the most notable
is the [Hyper](https://python-hyper.org/) project, which is an umbrella project
that contains a number of useful HTTP and HTTP/2 tools for Python, including
the best pure-Python HTTP/2 stack available.
