## Hi. I'm Cory.

I'm a software engineer, a physics graduate, and an Australian. Want to find
out more? Pick a topic below and let's get started.

Alternatively, if you just want to chat or see my work, you can find me on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Lukasa), or on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Lukasaoz).

If you're concerned about data privacy when contacting me, here's some useful
information. I live and work in **London**, in the **United Kingdom**. My
personal email accounts are currently managed by **Google**. My work email is
managed by my employer, **Metaswitch Networks**, who are based in **London**.
My websites are hosted by **GitHub**.

### Me

I was born in Sydney, Australia, but I moved to Melbourne when I was very
young. I grew up in Melbourne, and spent my teenage years in Oxford, England. I
went to university in St Andrews, Scotland. Now, as an adult, I'm a software
engineer living in London.

Software engineering is my dream job and what I love to do. I work at an
[awesome company](http://www.metaswitch.com/) solving interesting problems.
When I'm not working there, you can find me working on a number of open source
projects.

In addition to programming, I love reading, watching films and television, and
sports. I'm a huge fan of a number of sports teams, including the Melbourne
Demons, the Bulleen Boomers, and the Opals.

If you feel like chatting (and I always do), you can find me on a number of
social networks, and on IRC, where I'm Lukasa.

### Programming

#### Employment

At my day job I'm a Software Engineer in the Networking Business Unit at
Metaswitch Networks. I'm a member of the team that develops Project Calico, our
open-source virtual networking solution.

#### Open Source

I'm an active member of the Python open-source community. In particular I
contribute heavily to the Python HTTP community. I'm a member of the
[Python Requests](http://python-requests.org/) core development team, working
with [Kenneth Reitz](http://kennethreitz.org/) and
[Ian Cordasco](http://www.coglib.com/~icordasc/index.html#resume). In addition,
I manage several of the associated libraries, including the OAuth extension for
Requests. I also develop my own extensions for Requests, as well as being a
core contributor to [urllib3](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3).

Away from Requests, I develop several of my own open-source projects, as well
as contributing to the open-source projects of others.
