I'm coming to the end of my time at PyCon 2015.

This is my second time at PyCon, and at this stage I can safely say that PyCon is my favourite conference, bar none. Other conferences are larger or funnier or weirder, but none of them revitalises me like PyCon does.

360 days a year I work on open source projects. I love building things for people and trying to make their lives easier, and mostly I find the work to be a good use of my time.

However, it is fundamentally work I do on top of my 40 hour a week day job. I do it for no pay, with whatever time I have available. Most of the time the work that I and the other open source maintainers in the world do goes relatively unnoticed and without thanks. Sometimes it gets noticed, for the wrong reasons, and we have to weather *ad hominem* attacks on our characters. Very rarely, someone notices and thanks us.

This confluence of features means that working on open source is physically and emotionally draining. Over the course of a year it takes a lot out of me, and a lot of open source developers are lost, often for good.

PyCon is the one event a year that gives me that energy back. One time a year I get to be surrounded by my peers and my users. Here I get to be reminded that the tools I work so hard to build provide value to people, and that other people can build really wonderful things on top of my work.

PyCon is a wonderful, beautiful, humbling experience. The community of people I've chosen to associate with is filled with kind, talented, generous people. Each year I look forward to spending a few days with you all, and so far it has never disappointed. Thank you all for making PyCon 2015 as magnificent as ever, and I hope to see you again in Portland next year.
